Let's assume we have a generic tree composed of consecutive integers (so if there is a 6 all numbers starting from
and including 0 up to it also need to exist on the tree), such as follows:

--image

Then we define this tree with a list L: [4, 4, 1, 5, -1, 4, 5] such as L(i) identifies the parent of i (the root has no
parent and is denoted with -1).
An internal node is any node of a tree that has at least one child, so in this case the total number of internal
nodes is 3.

Implement the find_internal_nodes_num function (total number of
internal nodes)
